        <h2 class="subtitle">Different types of Sentences</h2>
        <p class="page-text">In English grammar, there are four main types of sentences:<br>
        1. Declarative Sentences<br>
        2. Interrogative Sentences<br>
        3. Imperative Sentences<br>
        4. Exclamatory Sentences<br>
    </p>
<br><br>
<h2 class="subtitle">1. Declarative Sentences</h2>
<p class="page-text">Declarative sentences make statements or provide information. They end with a full stop/ period.</p>
        <blockquote class="side-cursive">
            <p>
                I enjoy playing the guitar.<br>
                Qutub Minar is situated in Delhi.<br>
                
            </p>

        Have you finished your homework?<br>

<blockquote class="side-cursive">

        What a beautiful sunset!<br>

        <h2 class="subtitle">1. Relative Pronouns</h2>
        <p class="page-text">A relative pronoun is a word that is used to connect an independent clause to a relative clause. Relative pronouns are meant to provide more information about the subject (noun or pronoun) it relates to. These relative pronouns function exactly like adjectives, and so the clauses they form can also be called adjective clauses.
        </p>

        <p class="page-text">Who – Refers to a person (the noun/pronoun/subject which does the action). <br>
            Whom – Refers to the object (the noun or pronoun that receives the action). <br>
            Whose – Used to show possession of something or someone. <br>
            That – Used in a defining clause that refers to a person, animal or thing. <br>

        <h2 class="subtitle">2. Possessive Pronouns</h2>
        <p class="page-text"> Possessive pronouns are pronouns that are used to show your possession or ownership of someone or something. They indicate that they belong to that particular person and no one else. Possessive pronouns can be used instead of a noun phrase to avoid any repetition.</p>
        <h2 class="subtitle">Examples of Possessive Pronouns</h2>
        <blockquote class="side-cursive">
            <p>

        <h2 class="subtitle">3. Reflexive Pronouns</h2>
        <p class="page-text">The word ‘reflexive’ means something that is directed towards the self. A reflexive pronoun, therefore, is expected to do the same thing. It reflects back on the pronoun. It takes the place of a subject pronoun and an object pronoun in a sentence.
        </p>

        <h2 class="subtitle">4. Demonstrative Pronouns</h2>
        <p class="page-text">Everyone might be familiar with the word ‘demo’. The word demo is most commonly used as an acronym for demonstration. Demonstration means to indicate, identify, point out, exhibit or explain something to someone. A demonstrative pronoun is used to do the same thing. It demonstrates or represents the nouns that act as the subject or object in a sentence.

        <h2 class="subtitle">7. Personal Pronouns</h2>
        <p class="page-text">A personal pronoun is a short word we use as a simple substitute for the proper name of a person. Each of the English personal pronouns shows us the grammatical person, gender, number, and case of the noun it replaces. I, you, he, she, it, we, they, me, him, her, us, and them are all personal pronouns.</p>
    
    <br><br>
    <h2 class="subtitle">Examples of Personal Pronouns</h2>
    <p class="page-text">Personal pronouns can be broadly classified into three main categories – <br><b>(i) First person pronoun</b><br><b>(ii) Second person pronoun</b><br> <b>(iii) Third person pronoun</b><br> These pronouns are used in the nominative and objective format and in the singular and plural forms.</p>

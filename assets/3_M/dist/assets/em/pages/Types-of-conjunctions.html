        <h2 class="subtitle">Different types of Conjunctions</h2>
        <p class="page-text">Conjunctions are mainly used to join actions, ideas and thoughts. They are categorised into three main types:<br>
            1. Coordinating Conjunctions<br>
            2. Subordinating Conjunctions<br>
            3. Correlative Conjunctions<br>
        </p>
        <h2 class="subtitle">1. Coordinating Conjunctions</h2>
        <p class="page-text">A coordinating conjunction is a short word that is used in a sentence to link or join two or more words, phrases or clauses that have equal grammatical and syntactic importance. Let us now look at how different dictionaries define coordinating conjunctions
            In the English language, there are seven coordinating conjunctions and they are referred to by the acronym FANBOYS. Given below are the coordinating conjunctions in English.<br>
            For<br>
            And<br>
            Nor<br>
            But<br>
            Or<br>
            Yet<br>
            So<br>
Now, take a look at how these coordinating conjunctions can be used differently to link the various parts of a sentence.<br>

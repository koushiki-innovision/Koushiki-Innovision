      <p class="page-description">The rule for conversion from active voice to passive voice is as follows:<br>
    <b>Rule 1:</b> First and foremost, identify the subject, verb, and object(S+ V+O) in the sentence to convert to passive voice.<br>
    <b>Rule 2:</b> Then interchange the object and subject with each other, that is, the object of the active sentence becomes the subject of the passive sentence.<br>
    <b>Rule 3:</b> Change the base verb in the active sentence into the past participle(third form of the verb) in a passive sentence.<br>
    <b>Rule 4:</b> The word by will be used before the subject in passive voice.<br>
    <b>Rule 5:</b> The pronoun in the sentence will also be changed.<br><br>

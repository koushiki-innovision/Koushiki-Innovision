        <h2 class="subtitle">What is an Article?
        </h2>
        <p class="page-text">An article is defined as “any of a small set of words or affixes (such as a, an, and the) used with nouns to limit or give definiteness to the application.” In English, ‘a’ and ‘an’ are called the indefinite article, and ‘the’ is called the definite article.” An article is “a type of determiner (word used before a noun) that shows whether you are referring to a particular thing or to a general example of something. The indefinite article is ‘a’ or ‘an’ and the definite article is ‘the’.
        </p>

        <blockquote class="side-cursive">
            <p>
                I saw <b>a</b> lion and <b>an</b> elephant on safari. <br>
                <b>The</b> lion was scary. <br>
            </p>

        <h2 class="subtitle">Types of Articles</h2>
        <p class="page-text">There are three articles in English – ‘a’, ‘an’ and ‘the’. These articles are divided into two types namely:
       <br> 1. Definite Articles <br>
        2. Indefinite Articles <br>
        </p>
<br>
        <h2 class="subtitle">1. Definite Articles</h2>
        <p class="page-text">Among the three articles, ‘the’ is said to be the definite article. A definite article is used to determine something that is specific or particular. It is also used before plural nouns and to indicate the superlative degree of comparison. Furthermore, it can be used before collective nouns as well.
            For example:
            </p>
        <blockquote class="side-cursive">
            <p>
                <b>The</b> Sun sets in <b>the</b> west. <br>
               
            </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p class="page-text">In the above sentence, the nouns ‘Sun’ and ‘west’ are proper nouns and are specific and so the definite article has to be used.

        <blockquote class="side-cursive">
            <p>
                
                <b>The</b> children are playing cricket.
                <br>
            </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p class="page-text">In the above sentence, the definite article is used to determine the plural noun, ‘children’.

        <blockquote class="side-cursive">
            <p>
                
                This is <b>the</b> world’s longest river.

                <br>
            </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p class="page-text">In the above sentence, the definite article is used to denote the superlative degree of comparison.

        <blockquote class="side-cursive">
            <p>
                
                <b>The</b> crowd sang along with <b>the</b> band.

                <br>
            </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p class="page-text">In the above sentence, the definite article is used before the collective nouns, ‘crowd’ and ‘band’.

        <h2 class="subtitle">2. Indefinite Articles</h2>
        <p class="page-text">The articles ‘an’ and ‘an’ are termed as indefinite articles. An indefinite article, as the name suggests, is used to indicate something that is not definite or specific. It can also be used before singular nouns.
            Among the indefinite articles, ‘an’ is used before singular nouns that start with vowel sounds and ‘a’ is used before singular nouns that begin with consonant sounds.
            
            For example:
            </p>
        <blockquote class="side-cursive">
            <p>
                I had <b>an</b> apple for breakfast.<br>
                I saw <b>an</b> aeroplane.<br>
               
 <br>
               
            </p>
        </blockquote>
        <img src="https://i.ibb.co/P96cHjg/5.png" alt=" " >
        <blockquote class="side-cursive">
            <p>
        She has <b>a</b> pet dog.<br>
        My father is <b>a</b> doctor.<br>
        </p>

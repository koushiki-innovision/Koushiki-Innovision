        <h2 class="subtitle">Different types of Tenses.</h2>
        <p class="page-text">In English grammar, there are three main tenses, and they are each further classified into four different forms, which sum up to twelve tenses in total. The three tenses in English are:<br>
            1. Present Tense<br>
            2. Past Tense<br>
            3. Future Tense<br>
        </p><br><br>
        <h2 class="subtitle">The four different forms are:</h2>
        <p class="page-text">
            1.Simple Tense Form<br>
            2.Continuous Tense Form<br>
            3.Perfect Tense Form<br>
            4.Perfect Continuous Tense Form<br>
            
        </p><br><br>
        <h2 class="subtitle">So, the twelve tenses in English are as follows:</h2>
     <p class="page-text">  1. Simple Present Tense<br>
       2. Present Continuous Tense<br>
       3. Present Perfect Tense<br>
       4. Present Perfect Continuous Tense<br>
       5. Simple Past Tense<br>
       6. Past Continuous Tense<br>
       7. Past Perfect Tense<br>
       8. Past Perfect Continuous Tense<br>
       9. Simple Future Tense<br>
       10. Future Continuous Tense<br>
       11. Future Perfect Tense<br>
       12. Future Perfect Continuous Tense<br></p>
       <br><br>
       <h2 class="subtitle"> Present Tense</h2>
       <p class="page-text">The present tense refers to the action or event that takes place or is taking place in the present. It represents the current activity or the present state of being of the subject in the given context.
    </p><br><br>
    <h2 class="subtitle">Types of Present Tense</h2>
    <p class="page-text">The present tense can be used in four different forms, namely: <br>
        1. Simple Present Tense – used to indicate the current action or an action that takes place regularly.<br>
        2. Present Continuous Tense – used to denote an action that is continuing at the present moment.<br>
        3. Present Perfect Tense – used to indicate an action that is used to denote an action that is indefinite and still has its effect on the subject or object in the sentence.<br>
        5. Present Perfect Continuous Tense – used to represent an action that began in the recent past and is still continuing.<br>
        </p><br><br>

    <h2 class="subtitle"> Simple Present Tense</h2>
    <p class="page-text">
        The simple present tense is employed in a sentence to represent an action or event that takes place or just happened in the given context at the present moment. The simple present is also called the present indefinite tense.<br><br>
        The structure of the simple present tense can be understood by analysing the positive, negative, interrogative and negative interrogative forms of the tense. Have a look at the following simple present tense structure chart so that you can understand easily how it works.

<h2 class="subtitle"> Present Continuous Tense</h2><br>
<p class="page-text">The present continuous tense, as the name suggests, is the form of tense that is used to denote an action that is ongoing or occurring in that current moment. It is also referred to as the present progressive tense as they represent the action that is progressing in the present. Let us now take a look at the definitions provided by various dictionaries about the present continuous tense</p>

<h2 class="subtitle"> Past Tense</h2>
       <p class="page-text">The ‘past tense’ form of a verb, as the term suggests, can be used to speak about or represent an event or action that already happened in the past. One important point you have to keep in mind is that a number of verbs, when used in the past tense, do not follow the general rule of adding ‘ed’ to the end of the verb to form the past tense. Take a look at the different definitions of past tense and the list of past tense verbs to develop a clear idea of the same.
    </p><br><br>
    <h2 class="subtitle">Types of Past Tense</h2>
    <p class="page-text">The past tense has four different forms to indicate the varied nature of actions that happened in the past. They are:
        <br>
       1. Simple Past Tense – used to indicate an action or event that happened in the past.<br>
       2. Past Continuous Tense – used to depict an action or event that was continuing in the past.<br>
       3. Past Perfect Tense – used to represent an event or action that happened in the past before. another event or action that happened in the past.<br>
       4. Past Perfect Continuous Tense – used to denote an action or event that was taking place in the past until another action or event happened in the past. <br>
        </p><br><br>

        <h2 class="subtitle"> Simple Past Tense</h2><br>
        <p class="page-text">The simple past tense, in English, is used to represent an action/event that took place in the past. With many verbs, the simple past tense is formed by adding an ‘ed’ or a ‘d’ to the end of the base verb. However, there are other verbs which behave differently and take different spellings when used in the simple past form. </p>

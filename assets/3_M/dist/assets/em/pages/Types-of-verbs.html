        </p>
        <h2 class="subtitle">1. Action Verbs</h2>
<p class="page-text">Action verbs, as their name says, are used to refer to actions. These can refer to physical actions that are performed with bodies or objects, such as jump, hit, or sing, or mental actions that we use our brains to perform, such as think, consider, or memorize. Most verbs you will find are action verbs.
<br><b>List of some action verbs:</b>
<br>
<b>run</b><br>
<b>swim</b><br>
<b>help</b><br>
<b>sing</b><br>
<b>dance</b><br>
<b>ignore</b><br>
<b>Believe</b><br>
</p><br>
<h2 class="subtitle">Examples of action verbs in sentences</h2>
<p class = "page-text">Each of these sentences uses action verbs. You’ll see that each verb is referring to a physical or mental action.
</p><br>
        <blockquote class="side-cursive">
            <p>
                I <b>work</b> at a factory.<br>
                Cats <b>chase</b> mice.<br>
            </p>
        </blockquote>
        <img src = "https://i.ibb.co/BtThMYz/40.png">
        <h2 class="subtitle">2. Static Verbs</h2>  
        <p class = "page-text">Unlike action verbs, stative verbs refer to conditions or states of being. Generally speaking, we use stative verbs to describe things like qualities, states of existence, opinions, beliefs, and emotions. When used in a sentence, stative verbs do not refer to actions. It is important to know that some verbs can be used as either action or stative verbs depending on their meaning in the sentence. We are less likely to use stative verbs in the continuous verb tenses.
            <br><b>List of some static verbs:</b>
            <br>
            <b>love</b><br>
            <b>want</b><br>
            <b>own</b><br>
            <b>have</b><br>
            <b>resemble</b><br>
           
        </p>
        <h2 class="subtitle">Examples of static verbs in sentences</h2>
        <p class = "page-text">These sentences all use stative verbs. You’ll notice that none of these verbs refer to actions.</p> 
        <blockquote class="side-cursive">
            <p>
                Allie <b>loves</b> her younger sisters.<br>
                My car <b>needs</b> an oil change.<br>
            </p>
        </blockquote>
        <img src = "https://i.ibb.co/JHStJ5x/41.png">
        <h2 class="subtitle">3. Transitive verbs</h2>
        <p class="page-text">A transitive verb is a verb that is accompanied by a direct object in a sentence. The direct object is the noun, pronoun, or noun phrase that is having something done to it by the subject of the sentence. Both action and stative verbs can have direct objects, which means they can both be used as transitive verbs.
        </p>
        <h2 class="subtitle">Examples of transitive verbs in sentences</h2>
        <p class = "page-text">The following sentences all contain examples of transitive verbs. As you read each one, consider what the direct object of the sentence is.
            <blockquote class="side-cursive">
                <p>
                    Leonardo <b>ate</b> a delicious pepperoni pizza.<br>
                   She really <b>hates</b> brocolli.<br>
                </p>
            </blockquote>
            <img src = "https://i.ibb.co/KKm9LvS/42.png">
            <h2 class="subtitle">4. Intransitive verbs</h2> 
            <p class="page-text">The opposite of a transitive verb is an intransitive verb. A verb is an intransitive verb if it is not used with a direct object. Remember, only nouns, pronouns, and  noun phrases can be direct objects. Prepositional phrases, adjectives, and adverbs cannot be used as direct objects. Once again, both action and stative verbs can be used as intransitive verbs.
          </p>
        <h2 class="subtitle">Examples of intransitive verbs in sentences</h2>
        <p class="page-text">Each of these sentences uses intransitive verbs. Look carefully and you will see that none of these sentences have direct objects.
        </p>
        <blockquote class="side-cursive">
            <p>
                Airplanes <b>fly</b>.<br>
                The terrified monkeys <b>hid</b> in the trees after they saw the gigantic hungry snake.<br>
            </p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2 class="subtitle">5. Linking verbs</h2> 
        <p class="page-text">Linking verbs are a special type of stative verb whose name gives a big clue as to what they do. Linking verbs are used to link a subject with a subject complement. A subject complement describes or identifies the subject of the sentence or clause. Linking verbs can function as intransitive verbs, which do not take direct objects.
            Some of the words used as linking verbs are
            be,
            become,
            seem,
            appear,
            grow.
            
      </p>
    <h2 class="subtitle">Examples of Linking verbs in sentences</h2>
    <p class="page-text">In each of the following sentences, linking verbs are used to link a subject with a subject complement.

    </p>
    <blockquote class="side-cursive">
        <p>
            Mike <b>is</b> a great dancer.<br>
            That gold watch <b>looks</b> expensive.<br>
            Suddenly, the mall <b>got</b> really crowded.<br>
        </p>
    </blockquote>

    <h2 class="subtitle">6. Helping verbs</h2> 
    <p class="page-text">Helping verbs, also called auxiliary verbs, are helpful verbs that work with other verbs to change the meaning of a sentence. A helping verb combines with a main verb in order to accomplish different goals. These include changing the tense of the verb or altering the mood of a sentence.
        List of some words used as helping verbs
        be,
        have,
        do,
        can,
        will.
        
        
  </p>
<h2 class="subtitle">Examples of Helping verbs in sentences</h2>
<p class="page-text">Each of the following sentences uses a helping verb. Take a moment to consider what each sentence is saying and how a helping verb contributes to the meaning of the sentence.


</p>
<blockquote class="side-cursive">
    <p>
      
        The musician <b>has</b> performed in concerts all over the world.<br>
        Cheetahs <b>can</b> run incredibly fast.<br>
    </p>
</blockquote>
<img src = "https://i.ibb.co/k2P9dff/45.png">
<h2 class="subtitle">7. Modal verbs</h2> 
<p class="page-text">Modal verbs are a subgroup of helping verbs that are used to give a sentence a specific mood. Each modal verb is used differently, and they can express concepts such as ability, necessity, possibility, or permission.
    List of verbs used as modal verbs
can,
may,
might,
must,
would.

    
    
</p>
<h2 class="subtitle">Examples of modal verbs in sentences</h2>
<p class="page-text">The following sentences all use modal verbs to express a certain tone. You’ll see that each sentence would have a different meaning (or wouldn’t make sense) without the modal verb.


</p>
<blockquote class="side-cursive">
<p>
  
Once you finish your homework, you <b>may</b> play outside.
<br>
We <b>must</b> carefully add two eggs to the mixing bowl.
<br>
</p>
</blockquote>
<img src = "https://i.ibb.co/xMy7YVK/46.png">
<h2 class="subtitle">8. Regular verbs</h2> 
<p class="page-text">A verb is considered a regular verb if its past tense form and past participle ends in -ed, -d, or the verb is a -t variant verb. For example, the verb look is a regular verb because both its past tense form and past participle is looked. Sometimes, regular verbs may slightly change spelling. For example, the past tense and past participle of cry is cried.
List of some regular verbs are<br>
jump becomes jumped<br>
slip becomes slipped<br>
try becomes tried<br>
sleep becomes slept<br>
lend becomes lent<br>
    
</p>
<h2 class="subtitle">Examples of regular verbs in sentences</h2>
<p class="page-text">Each of the following sentences use regular verbs in either their past tense form or as a past participle.

</p>
<blockquote class="side-cursive">
<p>
  
    He <b>walked</b> two miles to the post office.
<br>
We <b>purchased</b> all of the supplies that we <b>needed</b> for the camping trip.
<br>
</p>
</blockquote>
<img src = "https://i.ibb.co/zFqm3QV/47.png">
<h2 class="subtitle">9. Irregular verbs</h2> 
<p class="page-text">An irregular verb is a verb whose past tense and past participle form doesn’t end in -ed, -d, and doesn’t use the –t variant. Often, the spelling of these verbs changes dramatically or may not even change at all.

List of some irregular verbs are<br>
be becomes am, is, are, was, were, be, being, and been<br>
eat becomes ate, eaten<br>
fly becomes flew, flown<br>
catch becomes caught, caught<br>
set becomes set, set<br>

    
</p>
<h2 class="subtitle">Examples of irregular verbs in sentences</h2>
<p class="page-text">The following sentences use irregular verbs. Despite being used in the past tense or as a past participle, none of these verbs end in -ed, -d, or are a -t variant verb.


</p>
<blockquote class="side-cursive">
<p>
  
    Cindy <b>knew</b> all of the right answers.

<br>
This junky computer has <b>given</b> me nothing but headaches since I <b>bought</b> it.

<br>
</p>

<h2 class="subtitle">10. Phrasal verbs</h2> 
<p class="page-text">Phrasal verbs are combinations of a verb with prepositions and/or adverbs that have a different meaning from the individual words used to form them. For example, the verb shut means “to close,” and the adverb down means “not up” or “in a descending direction.” However, the phrasal verb shut down means to stop the operation of something.


List of some phrasal verbs are<br>
ask for<br>
put up with<br>
talk down to<br>
lock up<br>
cut across<br>

    
</p>
<h2 class="subtitle">Examples of phrasal verbs in sentences</h2>
<p class="page-text">The following sentences show how we can use phrasal verbs. Sometimes, we can separate out the words of a phrasal verb and the sentence is still grammatically correct.


</p>
<blockquote class="side-cursive">
<p>
  
    The frustrated business owner <b>closed down</b> his store.<br>
    Dave loves to <b>show off</b> his baseball trophies.<br>
</p>
</blockquote>
<img src = "https://i.ibb.co/V2kZhPf/49.png">
<h2 class="subtitle">11. Infinitives</h2> 
<p class="page-text">Our last type of verb isn’t actually a verb at all—sorry about that! However, infinitives look a lot like verbs because they are derived from them. An infinitive of a verb is identical to the base form of the verb. For example, the infinitive form of the verb open is open. Typically, we use infinitives with the word to in order to form infinitive phrases. Infinitive phrases can be used for a variety of reasons, such as to act like nouns, adjectives, or adverbs.    
</p>
<h2 class="subtitle">Examples of infinitive phrases in sentences</h2>
<p class="page-text">All of the following sentences use infinitive phrases. In order, the infinitive phrases are acting as a noun (nominal infinitive), an adjective (adjectival infinitive), and an adverb (adverbial infinitive).


</p>
<blockquote class="side-cursive">
<p>
  
    <b>To play</b> guitar in a rock band is my goal.
<br>
The writing in the letter was too small <b>to see</b>.
<br>

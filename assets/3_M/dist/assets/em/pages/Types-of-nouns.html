        <h2 class="subtitle">1. Proper Nouns</h2>
        <p class="page-text"> Nouns that are used to name a person, place or thing specifically are called a proper noun. Proper nouns always begin with a capital letter.
        </p>
        <blockquote class="side-cursive">
            <p>
                This is my dog, <b>Bruno</b>. (Name of a specific pet animal owned by someone)<br>
                <b>Louis Philippe</b> is a famous brand of men’s clothing. (Name of a particular clothing brand)<br>

        <h2 class="subtitle">2. Common Nouns</h2>
        <p class="page-text"> Common nouns are those nouns that refer to a generic item, group or place. This means that, unlike proper nouns, they are not used to identify specific people, places or objects. Common nouns are not capitalized unless they appear at the beginning of a sentence.

        </p>
        <blockquote class="side-cursive">
            <p>
                I am going to <b>school.</b> (Common place)<br>
                The <b>car</b> is out of <b>fuel</b>. (Common items)<br>

        <h2 class="subtitle">3. Singular Nouns</h2>
        <p class="page-text"> These are words that are used to name a single person, place, animal, bird or object.
        </p>
        <blockquote class="side-cursive">
            <p>
                There is a little <b>boy</b> in front of our house. (Single person)<br>
                I found a wounded <b>sparrow</b> in the bush. (Single bird)<br>

        <h2 class="subtitle">4. Plural Nouns</h2>
        <p class="page-text"> Plural nouns refer to a number of people, places, animals or things. Nouns are made plural by adding an ‘s’ or ‘es’ or ‘ies’ or ‘ves’ to the existing root word. Nouns that end with an ‘s’ remain the same. Some nouns remain the same in both their singular and plural forms, and some others have totally different spelling.

        </p>
        <blockquote class="side-cursive">
            <p>
                I bought <b>mangoes</b> from the market.<br>
                We took photos of some <b>deer</b> on our way.<br>

        <p class="page-text">Countable nouns are those nouns that can be counted or measured.

                Tom brought <b>ten packets of lays</b> for the trip. (specific number – ten)<br>
                Mom asked me to buy <b>a dozen eggs</b>. (specific – dozen means twelve)<br>
      
        </blockquote>

        <h2 class="subtitle">6. Uncountable Nouns</h2>
        <p class="page-text"> Uncountable nouns are those nouns that cannot be counted. This category of nouns includes both concrete and abstract nouns.

        <blockquote class="side-cursive">

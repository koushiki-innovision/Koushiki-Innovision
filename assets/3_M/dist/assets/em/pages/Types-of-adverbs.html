        <h2 class="subtitle">2. Adverbs of Place</h2>
        <p class="page-text">Adverbs that are employed in a sentence to describe the location or the place where an action is taking place are called adverbs of place. They answer the question ‘where’. They are mostly found after the main verb or the object in a sentence. They can also refer to distances or the movement of an object in a particular direction.
            Given below are examples of how adverbs of place can be used to depict the location of the action in a sentence.
            
        </p>
        <blockquote class="side-cursive">
            <p>
                The boy was asked to keep the cups <b>here</b>. <br>
                The little girl ran <b>towards</b> her mother the moment she saw her. <br>
                Robert stood <b>outside</b> the store. <br>
            </p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2 class="subtitle">3. Adverbs of Manner</h2>
        <p class="page-text">An adverb of manner as “an adverb that shows how someone does something or how something happens. For example, in the sentences ‘Drive carefully’, ‘He talks too fast’, ‘The moon shone brightly’, and ‘I accidentally deleted the file’, ‘carefully’, ‘fast’, ‘brightly’ and ‘accidentally’ are manner adverbs.” The word ‘manner’, is defined as “the way in which something is done.” So an adverb of manner can be said to be one which depicts the way in which an action is done.
            Take a look at the following examples to learn how you can use adverbs of manner effectively.

            
        </p>
        <blockquote class="side-cursive">
            <p>
                He ran <b>quickly</b>. <br>
                I can write and listen to music <b>simultaneously</b>. <br>
                He swims really <b>well</b>. <br>
            </p>

        <h2 class="subtitle">4. Adverbs of Frequency</h2>
        <p class="page-text">An adverb of frequency is used in a sentence to give more information about the verb, adjective or another adverb. Adverbs of frequency can be placed after the noun or pronoun that acts as the subject and before the verb if there is just one verb in a sentence. If there is more than one verb in a sentence (e.g., auxiliary verb), the adverb of frequency can be positioned before the main verb.
            Have a look at the following sentences to understand how an adverb of frequency can be used.

            
        </p>
        <blockquote class="side-cursive">
            <p>
                Ashish <b>often</b> likes to have food from hotels.<br>
                We <b>never</b> like to have litchi juice from any other store. <br>
                Wiley <b>always</b> buys groceries from the supermarket.<br>

        <h2 class="subtitle">5. Adverbs of Degree</h2>
        <p class="page-text">An adverb of degree is employed in a sentence to depict the intensity or degree of an adjective, verb or another adverb. It usually answers the question ‘to what extent’. They are normally positioned before the word (an adjective in most cases) they are modifying.Given below are some examples for how adverbs of degree can be used in sentences.

            
        </p>
        <blockquote class="side-cursive">
            <p>
                The coat was big <b>enough</b> for him.<br>
                Her dress was <b>very</b> elegant.<br>
                The soup was <b>too</b> hot for me to eat.<br>
